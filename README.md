# Federama
**Federama** will be a PHP framework that utilizes ActivityPub to connect with the Fediverse. It is an outgrowth of work being done on [**Amore**](https://github.com/lafnlab/Amore). It will use PHP 7.2 and MariaDB/MySQL as a database.

In keeping with the concept of [selfdogfooding](https://indieweb.org/selfdogfood), **Federama** will also be a blogging platform where people can comment while using their Fediverse credentials. It will have posts, pages, categories, tags, comments, and media pages. It will also allow themes and plugins at some point.
